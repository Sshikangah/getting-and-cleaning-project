##Data documentation
Data collected from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Smartphone-Based+Recognition+of+Human+Activities+and+Postural+Transitions. 
The study used 30 volunteers between 19- 48 years of age. Each participant performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) while wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz.Two datasets, were originally created: 70% for training data and 30% for test data. Datasets were processed as follows;
1.	Downloaded files include:
test/subject_test.txt
test/X_test.txt
test/y_test.txt
train/subject_train.txt
train/X_train.txt
train/y_train.txt
features.txt
activity_label.txt
Downloaded syntax are located at run.analysis.R files.
2.	Renaming columns and Merging datasets: 
a.	Merge X_train.txt and Y_train.txt for activity training, 
b.	Merge Y_test.txt and Y_test.txt for Activity testing, 
c.	Subject_test.txt and subject_train.txt form participant data
3.	Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
4.	Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
5.	Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
6.	From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
