##Data documentation
Data collected from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Smartphone-Based+Recognition+of+Human+Activities+and+Postural+Transitions. 
The study used 30 volunteers between 19- 48 years of age. Each participant performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) while wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz.Two datasets, were originally created: 70% for training data and 30% for test data. Datasets were processed as follows;
1.	Downloaded files include:
test/subject_test.txt
test/X_test.txt
test/y_test.txt
train/subject_train.txt
train/X_train.txt
train/y_train.txt
features.txt
activity_label.txt
Downloaded syntax are located at run.analysis.R files.
2.	Renaming columns of raw dataset

3. 	Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
a.  merge training data files using cbind
b.  merge test data files using cbing
c.  combine both training and test datasets to one dataset.
d.  clean dataset for duplicates

4.	Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
a.  created logical vector to separate variables with mean and std by false or true
b.  select only those that are equal to true
5.	Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
a.  Cleaning up the variable names by renaming ana replacing using gsub

6.	Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
a.  Merging the cleanData with activityLabels to include descriptive acitvity names

7.	From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
a. calculate means using aggregate, relabel activity variable and create cleanData.txt dataset
